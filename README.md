## The Question

Our question is *"How does sleeping duration affect student's MDS performance (grade)?"*

- We believe sleeping has a significant effect on students' grades. Therefore, we would like to test our hypothesis by conducting a survey in which we will ask several questions to find out the validity of our belief.

## Running the Analysis

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.ubc.ca/ubc-mds-2017/SleepMatters.git`

You need to be in the root directory of the project at your Terminal. Then, you need to run the following steps.

From your terminal, you can run `make all` at root directory of the project to run analysis at once.

- To run all scripts:   `make all`

- To clean all intermediate files:   `make clean`

If `make all` does not work as all files are present, you may first need to use `make clean` to clean the files. Then, `make all` will create the files again for you.
